# Route Finder

RouteFinder is an intuitive application that uses Mapbox to display your current location on a map and plot detailed routes from your position to any selected destination.

## How to run it
1. Clone the .env.template and rename it to .env.

2. Fill the environment variables accordingly

3. Create Angular Envs (optional)
```
npm run envs
```

4. For development run:
```
npm start
```

5. For production run:
```
npm run build
```

Note: Do not run the application directly with AngularCLI (unless the environment variables are created), since the environment variables are created based on the .env.
